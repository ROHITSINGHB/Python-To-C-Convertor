# Python-to-C Converter

A desktop application that translates a subset of Python code into C code, aimed at helping learners understand the relationship between Python and C programming languages.

## Features

- Converts selected Python code snippets to equivalent C code
- Robust tokenization logic with a 15% reduction in parsing errors
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter for live code conversion
- Supports interactive classroom sessions with live demonstrations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer)
- Tkinter for GUI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Navigate to the project directory  
   `cd python-to-c-converter`

3. Install dependencies (if any)  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the application  
   `python main.py`

## Usage

- Input Python code into the editor pane
- Click the "Convert" button to generate equivalent C code
- View the C code output live in the conversion pane
- Use the application in classroom or learning environments for code translation demonstrations

## Project Highlights

- Developed tokenization logic to accurately parse and convert Python code with 15% fewer errors
- Created an intuitive Tkinter GUI that facilitates live conversion and improves user experience
- Successfully used in 3 classroom sessions to aid peer learning and academic instruction

## Future Enhancements

- Expand support to cover more Python syntax and features
- Add code export functionality for saving converted C files
- Integrate syntax highlighting for both Python and C code panes
